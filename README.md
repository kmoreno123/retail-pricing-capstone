# Retail Pricing Trends Analysis

This project explores how retail product pricing varies over time by product type, tax status, and region â€” using Python and visual storytelling.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The goal of this analysis was to understand how essential and non-essential products have changed in price between 2020 and 2025, and to identify how taxation and region affect pricing trends.

Key insights include:
- **Essential products** saw consistent price increases, potentially due to inflation or supply chain constraints.
- **Infant & Baby Products** were the most expensive category overall.
- **Taxable items** had slightly higher average prices, even within the same category.
- **Regional pricing** varied significantly, with some provinces showing unique trends based on product type.

## ðŸ§  Skills & Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)**
- **Data Cleaning**
- **Time Series Analysis**
- **Z-score Outlier Detection**
- **PowerPoint** for executive-style presentation

## ðŸ“‚ Files in This Repo

- `capstone2-2.ipynb` â€“ Python notebook with full analysis and visualizations.


## âœ… Outcome

This project was completed as part of my Springboard Data Analytics bootcamp. It reinforced my ability to extract insights from messy data and communicate findings clearly to stakeholders.
